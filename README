PStoXPM: Postscript to XPM conversion utility
---------------------------------------------

PStoXPM reads in a file written in a simplified PostScript-like format, applies optional rotation, scaling, and translation transforms, then prints on standard output a corresponding XPM file.

DEVELOPMENT
===========

PStoXPM was developed on a Sony Vaio laptop running KUbuntu 8.04 (Hardy Heron), using the GNU C++ compiler with Eclipse.

USAGE
=====

PStoXPM is invoked by typing

	./PStoXPM <command line arguments>

at a command prompt. Command-line arguments are all optional and can be entered in any order. The command-line arguments supported by PStoXPM, as well as the default values that will be used if the argument is not specified, are as follows:

-f <filename> (hw1.ps)
	Name of input PostScript-like file

-s <real number> (1.0)
	Scaling factor to be applied. (w.r.t. (0,0))

-r <integer> (0)
	Degrees to rotate image.  (w.r.t. (0,0))

-m <integer> (0)
	Pixels to translate image in X direction.

-n <integer> (0)
	Pixels to translate image in Y direction.

-a <integer> (0)
	Lowest X coordinate to be displayed.

-b <integer> (0)
	Lowest Y coordinate to be displayed.

-c <integer> (0)
	Greatest X coordinate to be displayed.

-d <integer> (0)
	Greatest Y coordinate to be displayed.

Input files must contain a '%%%BEGIN' delimeter, at the beginning of some line, and an '%%%END' delimeter at the beginning of some line afterwards. All text outside of these delimeters will be ignored. All commands are between the two delimeters.

PStoXPM at this point supports only one command:

(x1) (y1) (x2) (y2) Line
	Draws a black line between (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).

Syntactically malformed commands will cause an error to be displayed, but will not cause an exit.

Please remember that XPM and Postscript treat Y coordinates differently. The (0,0) point in XPM is at the upper-left, while in PostScript it is at the lower-left.

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
==================

Type 'make' at a command line in the 'build' directory (under the source directory). Type 'make clean' to clean.
